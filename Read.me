Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Authentication System
This project demonstrates a simple authentication system based on Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), 
specifically using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic. The system allows users to register with a password and 
authenticate themselves without revealing the password to the server, which provides security and privacy benefits.

Background
A Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic method where one party (the prover) can prove to another (the verifier) 
that they know a secret without actually disclosing it. This approach is widely applicable in secure authentication, as the 
verifier never learns the prover‚Äôs actual password or secret, preventing unauthorized access if the verifier‚Äôs data is compromised.

This project implements a ZKP authentication system using:

Prime Number (p) and Generator (g) to define a secure mathematical group.
Challenge-Response Mechanism to ensure unique, verifiable proof for each login session.
Implementation Overview
The system uses modular arithmetic and bitwise operations to securely generate and verify proof during the authentication process. 
Here‚Äôs an outline of the steps involved:

Registration: A user registers with a password, which is hashed and transformed into a public key.
Login (Authentication):
The user generates a commitment and sends it to the server.
The server issues a challenge to the user.
The user responds with a proof based on the challenge and their secret.
Verification: The server verifies the response using modular arithmetic, confirming that the user knows the secret without knowing the secret itself.

g
p: A large prime number that defines the finite group in which calculations are performed. For enhanced security, a large prime number should be used.
g: The generator of the group, which allows both the server and client to perform verifiable calculations.

3. Challenge-Response Protocol
A unique challenge-response process between the client and server ensures that each login attempt is verifiable yet unrepeatable, providing security against replay attacks. The challenge-response mechanism requires the client to respond dynamically to a random challenge from the server, making each authentication unique.
