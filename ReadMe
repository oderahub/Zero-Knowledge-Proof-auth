## ZKPLoginSystem
  ## Overview
ZKPLoginSystem is a basic login system based on Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), a  technique allowing users to authenticate without revealing their passwords.

## How It Works
1. Registration
When a user registers, they provide a username and password. The password is hashed to create a secret number (x). Using this secret, a public key (y) is generated, where:

p is a large prime number.
g is a base number used for exponentiation.
The system then stores the username and public key (y) in userDatabase, while the secret number (x) remains hidden.

2. Login (Challenge-Response Process)
The login process uses a challenge-response mechanism where the server verifies the user's identity by sending a random challenge rather than asking for a password.

##  Step-by-Step Login
## Challenge (Server):

The server initiates login by selecting a random number (r) generated by the user.
It calculates a temporary value, a = g^r % p, and sends it to the server.
Challenge Generation (Server):

The server generates a random number, known as the challenge, and sends it to the user.
## Response (User):

The user uses the challenge to calculate a response (z) based on their secret key x and random number r.


This z value is returned to the server as proof of identity.

## Verification (Server):

The server verifies the response by calculating two values:
Left side: g^z % p
Right side: (a * y, challenge, p) % p
If the left side equals the right side, the user is successfully authenticated.
